// VARIABLES
// We can create variables using let, var & const keywords
var x = 10;
var y = 100;
var z = 200;

// The 'let' keyword provides better scoping and helps prevent some common programming mistakes
let w = 100;
let q = "welcome";
let t = 23;

const o = "orange"; // a value that can't be changed

// DATA TYPES
// JavaScript is a dynamically types language, so we don't explicitly have to declare the data type

// PRIMITIVE - number (whole and decimal), string, boolean, null, undefined
// NON-PRIMITIVE - object, array, function, date, regex

console.log(typeof x); // find the data type of a variable

// 'undefined' is a value that has been declared but not initialized
